<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The other concept to understand is the forklift's center of gravity. We rent the following forklift equipment: Caterpillar, Jungheinrich, and Harlo.

<p>Sleep soundly knowing that your business is covered when you buy a new forklift, used forklift or rent a forklift from us. Outdoor forklifts use pneumatic tires with deep treads and more ground clearance to make them easier to drive on rough terrains.
