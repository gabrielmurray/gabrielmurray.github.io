<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude. OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled.

If you are an avid off-roader, then the benefit of higher clearance will probably outweigh the drawbacks.</p>
