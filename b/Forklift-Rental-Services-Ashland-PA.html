The 44236 Series has two machines, with capacities of 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, offering lift heights up to 34 feet.

<p>Types of jobs where you might encounter rough terrain forklifts are lumber yards, builders, brick yards, land movers, construction workers, etc. Product-line features: Each of the four current Xtreme straight-mast forklifts offers choices in their mast, carriage and fork configurations, as well as such options and accessories as fourth function valves, a load cushion hydraulic system, a work-light package, a rotating beacon and mirrors.</p>
<p>These rough terrain forklifts come with a higher ground clearance that is crucial to work on cross-country terrain.
