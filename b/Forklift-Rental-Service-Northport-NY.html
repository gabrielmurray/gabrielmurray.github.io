This is highlighted by the impressive load capacity: Our low-level order pickers, for instance, can lift up to three pallets weighing up to 2.5 tons with their 2.4 metre long forks. The forklift training material fit our training needs nicely. They are more maneuverable and need less space to operate than sit-down forklifts.</p>

<p>To be fair, lifted trucks are not for everyone, however, and there are some drawbacks that go along with their advantages. Furthermore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that more than 540,000 forklift operators are employed across the country in all 50 states. Designed to work in narrow aisles, the electric reach stacker can tilt both forwards and backwards for safer load handling.</p>
