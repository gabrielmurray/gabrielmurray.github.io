<p>The G2 features a 4 inch elevated off road suspension lift, custom G2 wheels, and 33 inch all-terrain tires. Included in this class are lift trucks with 3 or 4 wheels and either cushion (solid) or pneumatic (air filled) tires. Four-wheel-drive is usually a selectable system designed to give better performance on broken terrain in low grip road conditions. A lifted truck can provide you with greater ground clearance beneath your truck, even if you choose a simple lift kit, which can help you with going off-road with your pickup.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>

<p>Telescopic handlers are also used very heavily on construction sites as well as in agriculture and have largely superseded masted rough terrain forklifts in both industries due to their greater flexibility. A lifted truck has a certain look. Powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries , include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>Both Gasoline engine type and LP gas engine type have stronger power, hence suitable for heavy goods cargo work, while Electric and fuel cell types have zero emission and great quietness, which are more suitable for in-warehouse work. Weight of vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); front wheels act as fulcrum or pivot point.</p>
