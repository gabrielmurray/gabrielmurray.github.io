On October 4, 2017, United Rentals announced it had acquired the assets of Superior Speedie Portable Services, Inc. With proper care and maintenance, a lifted truck provides many benefits for the off-road adventure seeker. We offer to our clients a Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck that has high load bearing capacity and is provided with nylon wheels for quiet and smooth rolling over rough surfaces.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain” does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parries.</p>
