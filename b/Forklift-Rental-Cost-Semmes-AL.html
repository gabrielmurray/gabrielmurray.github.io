Servicing industries including roadwork, forestry, agriculture, stock picking and more, we're Northern California's go-to source for Cat, Clark, Mitsubishi and other allied brand forklifts.

<p>Manufacturer of a wide range of products which include hydraulic hand pallet truck and high lift pallet truck. This quick market overview is not intended to be all-inclusive, either by manufacturer or by products within a manufacturer's lineup, but aimed rather at providing prospective buyers a sample of RT forklifts available. Partnering with Toyota Material Handling, a company committed to delivering outstanding customer service to your business via our dedicated 800+ staff, quality poducts and maximum uptime, just another great Toyota Advantage.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: to create a lifted truck, you take a normal truck (which was developed for agricultural purposes but is now primarily used to see over minivans in traffic) and you put a "lift kit" on it. I am not an expert on lift kits, but based on my personal observation, they offer sizes like "six inches," or "eight inches," or "tall enough to provide storm shelter for a herd of Black Rhinoceros." That one's a big seller here in the South.</p>
<p>The operator has to be aware of the forces bearing on the forklift as it turns corners. Comparable to the height capacity of a standard forklift, the outrigger legs on the front of the machine can support the load up to more than 30 feet.

Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift. If you need help choosing a suspension kit for your vehicle, or can't find the kit your looking for, contact one of our mechanics.</p>

When it comes to used cars & other pre-owned vehicles, our Phoenix, AZ dealership has plenty of used models of various body styles that serve our customers well. Attachments can be used with forklifts to make the work easier and add additional functions.</p>
<p>Counterweight - a mass attached to the rear of the forklift truck frame. I'm talking about the unGodly big, oversized tires, mudflaps, etc type of trucks that look completely and utterly ridiculous. Rough terrain forklifts provide a high degree of mobility and safety as well as access to areas that would otherwise be off limits. Featuring big, tractor-style tires that provide plenty of traction to handle even the most challenging outdoor terrain, these rugged trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and used outdoors.</p>
<p>Handle only loads within the rated capacity of the truck. Rated capacity of the truck must be visible by the operator. Better visibility With a lifted truck you are situated higher giving you better visibility. Looking for a custom, lifted truck in the Clearwater area can be hard at times especially finding a company that comes with a full back warranty, 3-year, 36,000 miles.</p>

Our electric Yale forklifts are perfect for improving uptime in any warehouse. For me, the back glass and top of my truck can be pretty difficult to reach by hand unless (even without a lift kit). Accelerate your distribution and reduce unnecessary handling time with electric powered order picking equipment.</p>
<p>Safe operation requires advanced skill and training in forklift usage, and specific protocols should be followed to ensure safety of the operator and others in the vicinity.

Weight capacity runs 6,000-12,000 lbs.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
