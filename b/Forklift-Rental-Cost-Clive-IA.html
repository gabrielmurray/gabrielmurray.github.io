<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>

Keep in mind that body lifting can only raise vehicles from 1 to 3 inches total, which means you cannot get a huge lift from these kits.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body.

The 35 Logistics counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Counterbalance and reach forklifts are two commonly used types of truck throughout a variety of industries. This can get a bit tricky and technical, so always make sure you have a licensed mechanic install this type of lift kit to ensure that the suspension still works afterward.</p>
<p>Even if repairs are necessary, a used forklift is cheaper to fix as the parts are less costly. The CASE H Series, for example, has a 45-degree forward tilt and 15-degree rear tilt; also, the mast collapses down during transport or when not lifting a load and then extends for a higher reach when in use. A lifted truck shows that there's more to a modern pickup than just its performance and tech features.</p>
