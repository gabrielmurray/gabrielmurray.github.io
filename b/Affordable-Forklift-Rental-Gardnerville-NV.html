A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg).

The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift.
