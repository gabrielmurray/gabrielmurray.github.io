If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>This mainly due to the growing demand for material handling equipment across the manufacturing industry. The 8,000 lb. electric 4-wheel is used in higher capacity operations.
