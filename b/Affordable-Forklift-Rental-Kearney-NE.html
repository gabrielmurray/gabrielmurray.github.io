<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations.

Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

<p>Many rough terrain forklifts come with either two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive options.

Lifted truck maintenance services require assessment of your brakes, shocks, wheels, as well as tires.</p>
