<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment.

Moreover, the increasing effort from the end users to efficiently utilize supply chain will create demand for Pallet Trucks to handle large number of transaction expected to further increase in the coming years as well.
