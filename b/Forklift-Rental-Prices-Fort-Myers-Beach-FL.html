<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>The types of tires on forklifts. When possible, push pallet jacks during transport. Lift Code 4: Side Loaders: High Lift Pallet. The electric pallet jack is motorised and thus provides for faster operation. With the test load elevated to maximum height, without change in the original 19 load overhang dimensions, the test platform should be titled to a minimum of 4 percent, without overturning the truck.</p>
