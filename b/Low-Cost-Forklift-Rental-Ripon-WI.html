<p>Comprehensive training courses covering the safe and efficient operation of Industrial Reach Truck equipment for operators of all skills and experience. Crown builds long-term value into all of its pallet trucks and the PTH Series is no exception. The majority of sit-down lift trucks also have simpler controls than their stand-up counterparts. Radnes Services Limited are London South's premier Caterpillar dealer offering the full range of material handling products to meet every requirement. The Company offers forklifts, lift trucks, dumpers, compactors, screeds, trowels, and telehandlers, as well as repairs and maintenance services.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
