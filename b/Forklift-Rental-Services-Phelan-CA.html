A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>

<p>If you prefer to communicate by email about our forklift sale in Surrey, complete our easy contact form and we'll get right back to you. Unlike other industrial trucks, they don't have a mast and use pallet forks or a platform to haul loads several inches off of the ground. From sit-down to stand-up electric counterbalanced forklifts, you can find the right model to suit your business.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
