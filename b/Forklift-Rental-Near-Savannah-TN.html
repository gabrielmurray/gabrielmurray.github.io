<p>These sorts of lifted trucks drive differently than stock models, due to the change of suspension and higher center of gravity, but can utilize mush larger tires than a factory model.

Lifted truck up-fits are either for utility, such as enhancing your truck's capabilities and performance, or to improve its appearance.

You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment.

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
