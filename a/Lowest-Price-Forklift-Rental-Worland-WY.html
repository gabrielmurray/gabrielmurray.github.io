<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking. Low noise and vibration, excellent all-round visibility and easy servicing allow for improved driver comfort and forklift truck durability.</p>
<p>These types of powered industrial trucks are almost exclusively powered by diesel engines and have pneumatic (air filled) tires. Remember: you always want to buy a forklift that has a slightly higher load capacity than what you think you will need. The mast is capable of rotating 90 degrees, and the forks can then advance like on a reach mechanism, to pick full pallets.</p>
