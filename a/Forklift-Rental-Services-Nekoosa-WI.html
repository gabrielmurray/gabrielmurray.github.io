While moving palletized loads is fastest and easiest, these machines can load and unload a variety of objects.</p>

Integral sideshift allows sideways movement of the forks to handle loads that may not be aligned with the truck.

<p>Whether you need a forklift for just a day, or a fleet of them for months, we'll negotiate a deal that works best for you. We currently have over 100 Forklifts in our rental fleet as well as Skid-Steer Loaders and a Telehandler. Adding to this, growth in sectors such as retail, FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) and pharmaceutical industries will boost the Pallet Trucks demand, especially in developing parts of the globe.</p>
<p>A lifted truck also has a higher resale value because of how valuable these trucks are. We have used lifted trucks in stock from time-to-time, but we cannot guarantee availability on pre-owned models due to frequent changes in our inventory. As a result, customers should contact our team with questions about these suspension lift kits. The taller tires get the differential higher off the ground, reducing the risk of damage from obstacles, and all four wheels gain maximum traction due to the lifted suspension.</p>
