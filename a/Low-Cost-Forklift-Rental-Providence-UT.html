You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>

Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>

If other tests of tests for trucks over 20,000 lb rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
