Used for handling large amount of materials, this product is designed with a high level of precision at par with international quality parameters. Whatever materials handling task you need fulfilling, Cat Lift Trucks offer you one of the most dependable and complete counterbalance forklifts in the industry.

<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

Whenever a truck is equipped with vertical only, or vertical and horizontal travel controls elevatable with the lifting carriage or forks for lifting personnel, the following additional precautions should be taken for the protection of personnel being elevated.</p>
<p>Although forklifts are fairly easy machines to operate, it is recommended that all drivers receive proper forklift training and certification. If other tests or tests for trucks over 10,000 pounds rated capacity are required, the details should be agreed upon between the interested parties.
