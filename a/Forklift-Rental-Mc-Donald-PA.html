OSHA General Industry Standard 1910.178()(1) Only stable or safely arranged loads shall be handled.

<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
<p>We have tons of lifted Chevy trucks, lifted Dodge trucks, lifted GMC trucks, lifted Jeeps, lifted SUVs, and more. Additionally, regular maintenance is necessary for gas forklifts to prevent breakdowns. Counterbalance forklifts are available in 4-wheel and 3-wheel configuration.
