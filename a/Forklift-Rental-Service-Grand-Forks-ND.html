<p>The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, of a load with a stated horizontal and vertical distance to the center of gravity of the load that a given truck, based on the strength of the various components of the truck and, when applicable also on 406 of this Standard, can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.
