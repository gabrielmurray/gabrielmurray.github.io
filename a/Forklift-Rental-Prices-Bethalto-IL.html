<p>Other organizations just don't want to buy new when they need this type of equipment only for temporary or seasonal tasks so they opt for a forklift rental. We specialize in new and used warehouse forklifts to include narrow aisle reach trucks, pneumatic tire and cushion tire forklifts , order pickers and electric and manual pallet jacks. IN June, 1946, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers adopted a resolution to develop a safety code on powered industrial trucks.</p>
<p>The goal of the course is to help small businesses become self-sufficient regarding forklift operator training (upon successfully attending the class, individuals are certified to train fellow workers at their own place of employment). The load capacity of the forklift will restrict the load capacity of the order picker cages. These kits cannot be installed in vehicles with a unibody construction, such as the Jeep Cherokee.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail. Customization and accessories for trucks go beyond what the manufacturer offers on brand new models, however, giving truck drivers even more freedom to make their pickups their own. Forklift rentals require research and planning, and that's where the experienced team at Thompson Lift Truck can help.</p>

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilises a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>With the Operator Presence Sensing (OPS) System, the reach truck becomes inoperative when the floor switch cannot detect the driver. For nearly 50 years, customers have relied on the Cat lift trucks brand for quality and reliable forklifts backed by exceptional service and support through its trusted dealer network. If your company has a forklift that's dead in the water, ForkliftTrader does on-site service calls.</p>
<p>The forks on a reach truck are attached to a pantograph mechanism that extends them forward to place in or retrieve pallets from warehouse racking. Order pickers feature an elevating platform that brings the operator to the level of the stock, similar to a cherry picker. The extra-long frame combined with a larger counterweight means this model can handle larger loads.</p>
