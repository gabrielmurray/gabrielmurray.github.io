<p>Rent a forklift with a configuration that makes you most productive. Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck. Diesel forklifts are strongly recommended if the forklift will be used for heavy lifting or outdoors.
