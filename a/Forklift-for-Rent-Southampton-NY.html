<h2>Five Questions to Ask When Buying Used Forklifts in Southampton </h2>
<p>If you rent forklift then it will work as a power based truck to lift and move industrial and raw materials. Experience proves that operators who are properly trained, keep within the forklift's load capacity, and follow rules of safe operation to avoid tipovers and accidents. In order to prevent the lift from tipping, the combined center of gravity of the load and the lift must stay inside the stability triangle (at ground level) at all times.</p>

Atlantic Training's "Forklift Safety: Industrial Counterbalance Lift Trucks" training program has been designed to introduce employees to the forklift they'll be using, explain its capabilities and limitations, and show them how to operate and maintain it properly.</p>

We recommend this pallet jack due to its' heavy duty structure and its affordability. 42% of the forklift fatalities are caused by forklift driver being crushed by a lift truck that tips over.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
