<h2>Used Pallet Jack Kennesaw</h2>
<p>These Class 4 forklifts are one of the most commonly used forklifts in the U.S., typically used indoors for applications such as manufacturing, warehousing, bottling, and trucking. Linear speed control, an option on many competitors' trucks, is standard on all SP models and utilizes a variable height sensor to measure platform height and determine the optimum speed level.</p>
<p>OSHA requires that all forklift operators' performances be evaluated at least once every three years. With more than 50 models to choose from, our forklifts are manufactured with superior quality. This type of forklift is suited for uneven surfaces with its sturdy pneumatic tires. By applying air pressure to the lift axle, the driver is able to add one more axle into the equation and relieve some of the weight being supported by the other axles.</p>
<p>You can rely on Westminster Lift Truck Services. These forklifts can come with lifting heights of up to 20 feet. Before OSHA can issue a standard, it must go through a very extensive and lengthy process that includes substantial public engagement, notice and comment. The cages are manufactured in accordance with the strictest safety standards, including AS 2359.1. Both cages - type MWPOP and MWPOPG - must only be used by a dedicated Order Picking Forklift.</p>
