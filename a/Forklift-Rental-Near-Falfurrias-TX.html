<p>At the time, Vincent Halma, president and CEO of KION North America, said the rate at which we're releasing new products and services is truly unprecedented.” KION also recently announced plans to expand its South Carolina facility capacity to 12,000 lift trucks a year by 2020, up from 3,000 in 2015.
