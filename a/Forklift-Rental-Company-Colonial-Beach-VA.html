<p>Welcome to the home of Doosan Forklifts in the UK. It is also permissible to use two test loads of equal weight suspended from the ends of a transverse beam fastened to a framework supported by the forks as described in item 3, provided the loads are suspended from points equidistance from centerline of trucks, and provided that a straight line from one point to the other passes at a height above the forks and at a distance from front face of forks equal to the rated load center dimension before weight of test load has caused forks to deflect.</p>
<p>The company says its new products offer advances in efficiency technology with Toyota's optional Lift Logic Speed and Height Control System, enabling fast and easy picking. As one of the leading forklift companies in Melbourne and throughout Victoria, we can provide you with high-quality solutions for your particular project - whatever that might be.

<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>There is nothing like the ride that is achieved from air suspension. The order picker forklift has a small platform big enough for the operator to stand behind the forks with controls for operating the forks. Suspension lift kits can raise a truck a full foot from where it started, and they aren't just lifting up the truck's body and putting it back again.
