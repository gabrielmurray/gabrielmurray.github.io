An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load.

<p>The Southeast team has an independent network of 2500 + independent buyers of forklifts. The purchase of high-quality industrial machinery is a big investment, no matter the size of your business. This kit is designed for drivers who want to install larger tires on their truck for high-level performance off-road. The most maneuverable of the bunch, and also one of the most fun to operate, reach trucks are designed for warehouse applications and other locations that routinely stack palletized goods in racking or other storage areas.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>How to choose the right forklift for your business. The spacious cab and adjustable controls offer the operator great comfort, even at height. Driving a couple of inches higher won't only provide you with an improved view of the road, but your vehicle's body and lower parts will also be considerably safer from flood water and street debris. Our comprehensive counterbalance forklift range enables us to supply you with the best forklifts to get the job done.</p>

<p>In that time, we've come to be experts on everything the lifted truck segment has to offer, so no matter what you need to know, we're confident that we can answer all your questions. Lifted Jeeps are particularly popular for driving off-road and on rough terrain due to their additional ground clearance and the ability to use larger tires and wheels. There is a common misconception regarding forklift licenses and the corresponding training.</p>

Standard 2-ton counterbalance forklifts can cost over $20,000 in good condition, and many cost much more when brought brand new.
