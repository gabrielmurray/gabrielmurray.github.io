<p>Quality parts for all lift trucks and all lift truck needs. If a truck is lifted for functional reasons and it actually functions better it's an improvement. Operate trucks equipped with attachments as partially loaded trucks when not handling a load. If you're ready to learn more about Crown Forklifts and how Cardinal Carryor can assist with your material handling needs, call 1-800-666-5600 or Contact Us now and let's get started.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
