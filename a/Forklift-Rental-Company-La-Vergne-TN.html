<p>Most RT forklifts available in the North American market use Tier 4-Final engines, and many of these engines are rated at 74 horsepower, such as the 4.4-liter JCB EcoMax engine used in the company's model 950 RT forklift. A person performing this work is required to hold an order picking forklift truck high risk work (HRW) licence. Your 4×4 truck can be your ticket to off-road adventures, your daily driver around town, your hauling and towing machine, or your work truck.</p>

Toyota's 7-series reach truck offers the industry's first AC Power System,along with Traction & Brake Control which gives improved traction, better braking and suspension control for more stability. Whilst there are some limitations - such as the electric battery and low ground clearance - if used in the correct manner a reach forklift can be a valuable addition to a savvy warehouse's equipment.</p>
<h2>Fork Truck Certification La Vergne</h2>
<p>This workshop is designed for participants who have little or no working knowledge of operating a counterbalance forklift. Do not steer pallet jacks onto uneven surfaces and avoid steep inclines.

Class I lift trucks are extremely versatile and can be used in many areas of a production operation from the loading dock to the storage facility.</p>
