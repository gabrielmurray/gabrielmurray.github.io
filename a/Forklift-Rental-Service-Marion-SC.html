<p>The desire to own the biggest, baddest, shiniest forklift fresh off the assembly line is understandable. An overloaded pallet jack is likely to break down and can pose a serious safety hazard for its operators. The Rough Terrain Pallet Truck comes with Extended Raised Height compared to standard pallet trucks.

The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
