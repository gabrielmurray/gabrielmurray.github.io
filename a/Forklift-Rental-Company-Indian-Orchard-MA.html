<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Travelling and manoeuvring with the machine safely over a range of terrains, including steep inclines and undulating surfaces. Capable of handling heavy loads on all terrain types, Access Hire Australia's range of rough terrain forklifts are highly versatile machines.

<p>When necessary, operators can switch Dual-Mode Yale robotic lift trucks to manual mode to handle excess volume or other unexpected demands.

This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>
